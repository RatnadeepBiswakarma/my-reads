---

## Intro

* To change the book shelf select the select the shelf from the dropdown menu.
* If you want to remove the book from your shelf then select `Remove Book` from the dropdown menu.

## How to view the project in local machine

To view the project at your local machine do the following

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`
* a new window in your default browser will be opened if not 
* go to http://localhost:3000

## Backend Server

Backend server is powered by Udacity server and is coded by Udacity developers.

## Language and dependencies
* React
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
